# Student-Grade-Management

The Student Grade Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage and streamline the process of recording, updating, and analyzing student grades. The system includes the following key functionalities:

NOTE: Consider how to represent the list of grades that the user will be giving. Vectors? Arrays? We won't have an official database for this, so we'll have to be a little clever with our implementation.

GENERAL FUNCTIONS:
- User input function that validates the correct input
- Add task/grades
- Removing grades/removing a task
- View grades for students/viewing your to-do list
- Search for a student/assignment/task

ADVANCED FUNCTIONS:
(FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO TRY ADVANCED FUNCTIONS OR IF YOUR CS-2 AND ABOVE)
- Making a login page with a user id and password (password validation)
- Generate a graph to show all the data

Make sure to write comments when you are implementing the code!!
